## Basic construction of an HTML page

- `<html>` - This tag signals that from here on we are going to write in HTML code. After finishing the code we have close the tag by `</html>` closing tag.

- `<head>` - This element is a container for metadata. Metadata typically define the document title, character set, styles, scripts, and other meta information. After finishing **head** we have to close it by `</head>` tag.

- `<title>` - HTML title tag is used to provide a title name for your webpage. After giving title we have to close it by `</tile>`.

- `<body>` - This is the main and visual part of HTML. The `<body>` element contains all the contents of an HTML document, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.
